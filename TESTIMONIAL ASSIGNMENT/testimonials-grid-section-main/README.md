## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS (for styling)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
Working on this project further helped me understand using "Display; Flex" to manipulate the arrangement of my designs as well as using "Position Relative". My partner also gained indepth of using Media Query to make a mobile responsive design. 

## Acknowledgements

I am grateful for our bootcamp mentor who did an awesome job teaching us. I am also grateful for fellow cohorts who were kind enough to help me out and give pointers/tips where needed. Shout out to my partner as well for his efforts.
